# [CharSeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_siu)
SEO rules checking in expect style language.

# Design approach
CharSeo API has been inspired by [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/) and tries to mimic the natural language as much as possible. The grammar words can be broadly grouped in to 3 categories; subject, connective and action.

## Subject
- tag
- hasChild / hasChildren
- not

## Connective
- appear
- does

## Action
- exist
